# Apollo

Hello everyone, I'm Noah, I live an belgium and I'm 14 years old.
I've always wanted to make my own compiler from scratch. Of course this is very difficult
but I'm just going to try and we will see what happens.


My idea is to make a C like programming language. The compiler will be written in C.
